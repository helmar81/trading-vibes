"May 30, 2024: The CAFC is seeing an increase in crypto job frauds. Using the names of real companies in Canada, the fraudsters are offering victims freelance job opportunities to "boost" products, apps or videos using software created by the fraudsters. After the victim install the software and creates an account, they receive "orders" or "tasks" they have to complete. Victims might receive a small payment or commission in order to convince them that the job is legitimate.
Victims deposit their funds into crypto accounts or wallets. Similar to crypto investment scams, victims will see funds in their crypto account, but will not have the ability to withdraw the funds they have deposited and earned.‚Äù
