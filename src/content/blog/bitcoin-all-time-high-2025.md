## 🔮 Mid-to-Long-Term Predictions

If current conditions hold, we may be entering a Bitcoin *supercycle*. Predictions vary widely:

| Time Horizon | Price Target       | Reasoning |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 2025         | $150K – $200K      | ETF inflows, US deficit concerns |
| 2027–2030    | $250K – $500K+     | Long-term adoption, inflation hedge |

- **Bank of America** sees **$150K** due to institutional accumulation.
- **Ric Edelman** forecasts a dramatic surge to **$500K by 2030**, citing "once-in-a-generation" structural changes in finance.

## ⚙️ Key Drivers Behind the Rally

1. **ETF Inflows** – Spot Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in billions in institutional capital.
2. **Scarcity** – Exchange reserves are at multi-year lows; demand is far outpacing supply.
3. **Macro Trends** – Inflation, US deficits, and weakening fiat currencies are pushing capital toward BTC.
4. **Political Winds** – The “Crypto Week” legislative blitz and political support (especially from pro-crypto candidates) add tailwinds.
